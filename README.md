üçï Pizza Simulation Project
Overview
The Pizza Simulation project is a multi-threaded application that simulates the operations of a pizzeria, developed in C using pthreads on a Linux Virtual Machine. 
This project demonstrates key programming principles, including simultaneous programming, efficient resource management, and real-time order processing.

Features
Multi-threaded Architecture: Simulates concurrent workflows for order handling, preparation, baking, and delivery.
Realistic Order Management: Each stage of the pizza-making process operates in its own thread, mimicking real-world operations.
Efficient Resource Handling: Utilizes synchronization mechanisms to ensure smooth and accurate processing of orders.
